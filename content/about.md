# About Me

My name is Toku, a 27-year-old master student in Cyber Security in Belgium and cyber security coultant at a firm in Belgium.

## Background

In 2015, as a young adult, I was initially drawn to IT, particularly IT development. However, over the years, my focus shifted towards cyber security. Initially, my passion lied in program development. However, as I progressed through my studies, I discovered the fascinating world of cyber security and the individuals known as ‘hackers’. This discovery sparked my interest and eventually evolved into a deep passion.

I am passively active in the scene and typically you won't find me boasting around. I am a member of HSBxl, a hacker space in Brussels. Being part of this community allows me to both learn from others and share my knowledge with them.

In my university career, I delved into Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I have participated in several CTFs and was part of the team that achieved a top 10 placement in the Cyber Security Challenge Belgium.

I finished my master thesis, which focuses on establishing a standardized method for revoking security keys in password-less fashion.

## Employment

I am presently employed as a Cyber Security Consultant in a company based in Brussels. Within the application security team, I am tasked with ensuring the security of our clients' applications. Additionally, I am actively pursuing the CRTO certification. Looking ahead, I aspire to transition into a role as a red teamer and/or security analyst. With a broad knowledge of the cyber security field, I am always eager to expand my expertise.

## Values

I strongly believe in the open-source community and advocate for privacy and security. Both professionally and personally, I prioritize security and privacy. I advocate for the use of open-source and privacy-respecting software. I derive satisfaction from assisting others and am always open to helping individuals with their security and privacy inquiries. Although I do not allways practive what I preach but I am always happy to learn new ways!

Furthermore, I value secrecy and loyalty and prefer not to discuss my work in public. When asked about my profession, I typically provide a vague response such as "I work in IT" or "I work in cyber security."
