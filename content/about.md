# Whoami

My name is Toku, a 27-year-old with a Master's in Cyber Security from Belgium. I also work as a cybersecurity consultant at a firm in Belgium.

## Background

In 2015, as a young adult, I was initially drawn to IT, particularly IT development. However, over the years, my focus shifted towards cybersecurity. Initially, my passion was in program development, but as I progressed through my studies, I discovered the fascinating world of cybersecurity and the individuals known as "hackers." This discovery ignited my interest, which eventually evolved into a deep passion.

I am passively active in the scene, and you typically won't find me boasting. I am a member of HSBxl, a hackerspace in Brussels. Being part of this community allows me to both learn from others and share my knowledge with them.

During my university career, I delved into Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I have participated in several CTFs and was part of a team that achieved a top 10 placement in the Cyber Security Challenge Belgium.

I recently completed my masterâ€™s thesis, which focuses on establishing a standardized method for revoking security keys in a password-less environment.

## Employment

I am currently employed as a Cybersecurity Consultant at a company based in Brussels. As part of the application security team, I am responsible for ensuring the security of our clients' applications. Additionally, I am actively pursuing the CRTO certification. Looking ahead, I aspire to transition into a role as a red teamer and/or security analyst. With a broad knowledge of the cybersecurity field, I am always eager to expand my expertise.

## Values

I strongly believe in the open-source community and advocate for privacy and security. Both professionally and personally, I prioritize security and privacy. I advocate for the use of open-source and privacy-respecting software. I derive satisfaction from assisting others and am always open to helping individuals with their security and privacy inquiries. Although I do not allways practive what I preach but I am always happy to learn new ways!

Furthermore, I value secrecy and loyalty and prefer not to discuss my work in public. When asked about my profession, I typically provide a vague response such as "I work in IT" or "I work in cyber security."
